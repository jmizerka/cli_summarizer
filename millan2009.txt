The article presents the development and testing of an asynchronous, non-invasive brain-machine
interface (BMI) for controlling an intelligent wheelchair. The system uses EEG signals to detect the
user's mental state and translate it into commands for the wheelchair. The study involved three
subjects who learned to modulate their EEG oscillatory rhythms by executing three mental tasks
(mental imagery) associated with different steering commands. The system implemented shared control
techniques to assist the subject in the driving task. The results showed that the three subjects
could achieve a significant level of mental control of the intelligent wheelchair. The study
demonstrates the feasibility of using asynchronous, non-invasive BMIs for continuous control of
robots and has implications for improving mobility and independence for people with disabilities.The
article presents the development and testing of an asynchronous and non-invasive brain-machine
interface (BMI) for controlling an intelligent wheelchair. The BMI uses electroencephalography (EEG)
signals to distinguish between three mental tasks (mental imagery) associated with different
steering commands. The system implements shared control techniques between the BMI and the
intelligent wheelchair to assist the subject in the driving task.  The study involved three subjects
who participated in 20 calibration sessions to extract subject-specific stable discriminant EEG
features and build a statistical Gaussian classifier for each subject. The classifier processed each
of the EEG samples and combined eight consecutive responses to deliver a mental command every 0.5
seconds.  The results showed that the three subjects could achieve a significant level of mental
control of the intelligent wheelchair, with a signification level of 0.05. The system was able to
distinguish between the three mental tasks with an accuracy of 80-90%, and the subjects were able to
control the wheelchair's movement with a high degree of accuracy.  The study demonstrates the
feasibility of using asynchronous and non-invasive BMI for controlling an intelligent wheelchair.
The shared control approach adopted in the study ensures that the system provides navigational
assistance to users when needed, while still allowing users to maintain control over the wheelchair.
The results have implications for the development of BMI systems for controlling robots and
prosthetic devices, and could potentially improve the quality of life for people with disabilities.
